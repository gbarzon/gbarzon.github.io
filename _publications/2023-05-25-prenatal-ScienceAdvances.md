## Abstract
Human infants acquire language with notable ease compared to adults, but the neural basis of their remarkable brain plasticity for language remains little understood Applying a scaling analysis of neural oscillations to address this question, we show that newborns’ electrophysiological activity exhibits increased long-range temporal correlations after stimulation with speech, particularly in the prenatally heard language, indicating the early emergence of brain specialization for the native language.
