My name is Giacomo Barzon, I am currently a Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at the University of Padova, Italy, hosted by the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it). I am working under the supervision of Samir Suweis from the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/) and Manlio De Domenico from the [CoMuNe Lab](https://manliodedomenico.com).

I obtained a Master's degree in Physics of Data at the University of Padova, which combines a solid background in Physics with a strong focus on Data Science. Indeed, I like to combine analytical and computational approaches to tackle research problems.

My main interests are complex systems and network theory, with a focus on the brain. My passion for neuroscience can be summarized in the following picture:
