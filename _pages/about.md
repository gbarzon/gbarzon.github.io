My name is Giacomo Barzon, I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Padova, Italy, hosted by the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it).

I obtained both my BSc in Physics and my MSc in Physics of Data (a Master Degree recently activated that combines advanced knowledge in the field of Physics with a high-level training in Data Science) at the University of Padova, and I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

I'm currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Samir Suweis](https://suweis.github.io) from the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/) at the University of Padova and [Prof. Manlio De Domenico](https://manliodedomenico.com) from the [CoMuNe Lab](https://comunelab.fbk.eu) at the [Bruno Kessler's Foundation](https://www.fbk.eu/it/).

My main interests regard the study of the brain as an emblematic empirical complex system, using network structure and biologically inspired models of neural dynamics to investigate brain criticality and controllability, thanks to computational simulations and analytical tools mostly from statistical mechanics.
