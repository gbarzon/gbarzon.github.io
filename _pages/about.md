My name is Giacomo Barzon, I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Padova, Italy, hosted by the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it). I obtained both my BSc in Physics and my MSc in Physics of Data (a Master Degree recently activated that combines advanced knowledge in the field of Physics with a high-level training in Data Science) at the University of Padova, and I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

I'm currently working under the supervision of Prof. Samir Suweis from the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/) at the University of Padova and Prof. Manlio De Domenico from the [CoMuNe Lab]() at the [Bruno Kessler's Foundation]().

My main interests regards the model of brain architecture thanks to graph theory, which aims to perform analysis regarding brain activity, criticality and brain control. Both via computational simulations and analytical tools, mainly from statistical mechanics and graph theory.
