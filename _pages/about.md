My name is Giacomo Barzon, I am currently a Ph.D. student in Neuroscience at the University of Padova, Italy, hosted by the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it). I'm currently working under the supervision of Samir Suweis from the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/) and Manlio De Domenico from the [CoMuNe Lab](https://manliodedomenico.com).

I obtained both my B.Sc. in Physics and my M.Sc. in Physics of Data at the University of Padova, and I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

My main interests regard the study of the brain as an emblematic empirical complex system, using network structure and biologically inspired models of neural dynamics to investigate brain criticality and controllability, thanks to computational simulations and analytical tools mostly from statistical mechanics.

Here you can find the list of all my pubblications and a network representing my work and collaborators:
